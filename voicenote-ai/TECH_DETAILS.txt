VoiceNote AI - Technology Stack Overview

1. Frontend Framework:
   - React 18 (Vite-powered)
   - TypeScript for type safety

2. Styling & UI:
   - Tailwind CSS: Used for all styling, including a custom glassmorphic design system.
   - CSS Variables: Implemented a dual-theme system (Light/Dark mode) using CSS variables and Tailwind theme extensions.
   - Framer Motion: Used for smooth entrance animations and the recording pulse effect.
   - Lucide React: Providing the icon set (Mic, Sun, Moon, etc.).

3. State Management:
   - Zustand: Handles global application state (User authentication, Notes list, Theme preference).
   - Persistence: Theme and basic app state are persisted using browser localStorage.

4. Routing:
   - React Router v6: Manages navigation between Landing Page, Login, and the Dashboard views.

5. API & Database Status:
   - Current State: The application currently uses Mock Services for all backend functionality.
   - APIs: Mocked `authService`, `apiService` (for summaries), and `transcribeService`. No live external APIs are connected yet.
   - Database: There is no live database connection (MongoDB/PostgreSQL/DynamoDB) active yet. Data is currently simulated in-memory and persisted locally in the browser for demonstration purposes.
   - AWS Status: An `amplify.yml` exists, preparing the project for AWS Amplify deployment, but the actual cloud resources (Lambda, Transcribe, DynamoDB) have not been linked to the frontend code yet.
